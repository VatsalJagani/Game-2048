## User Perspective
This is a logical game.
You can found this game on Android's and Iphone's AppStore too.
All the things regarding this game including instruction you can found on internet.

	
## Programmer Perspective
Java code and Android code is already available on internet for the same game.
This program is created in C, Graphics is not used, Still it is Well formed.
I am also used some of the functions specific for Windows OS, because I used commands of windows. By removing those command (that dosen't affect working of game) can also use in other OS.

## Direct from Developer
This is my first special coding project.
Special thanks to Haresh Karena for their valuable inspiration.
Idea is already avaible I try to just apply different language.
